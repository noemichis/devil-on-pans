## DESIGN

### DATABASE

### AGILE

- GitHub issues and Github Projects were used to plans and manage the development process.  
- User Stories and Tasks were organized into Epics which then in Milestones
- Some issues have been moved around over the course of development 
- User stories have also been labeled according to the MoSCoW method.
- As issues were handled they have been moved from the  **Todo this Iteration**, to **In Progress**, to **Done**. If an issue couldn't be approached it was moved back to the **Backlog** for reconsideration, then into **Won't Have** if couldn't be implemented.
- The use of Agile has made the development process more efficient during active working times. Most of the calculations were made before major coding was done.
